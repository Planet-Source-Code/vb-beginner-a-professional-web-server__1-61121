### Description

YOU MUST TRY THIS NO MATTER WHAT! DON'T LEAVE UNTIL YOU DO! I NEED AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS POSSIBLE! Rate me, give as many comments as possible, give me improvements and complaints, and give the exact steps I need to improve some part of my project. This has anti-leech, default path, default listening port, directory listing, and others. Updated 6/14/05.
